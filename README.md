# HEALTH [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kdar/health.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kdar/health)

A library for marshaling and unmarshaling various EDI formats (NCPDP, EDIFACT, ...) and CCDs.

This is used in our medical backends, so it will be actively developed.

Look at tests for examples on usage. 

Any pull requests, questions, or reported issues are welcome.
